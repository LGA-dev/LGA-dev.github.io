## General info

This is my personal portfolio website.

I have been working on it for some time, but I have never uploaded it to the web.

There is a lot of things from this project that I have learned, such as sectioning the content in smaller parts to make it easier to read later and using responsive media queries to make it work on all screens.

Also I struggled a lot with the design, the first version had videos and a lot of unnecessary stuff that I have removed, so this version is much cleaner now.
